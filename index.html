        <h2>My favourite things</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Yoga - I did my ashtanga yoga teacher training in India and I'm currently doing a course in kundalini yoga.</li>
            <li>Digging for and playing vinyl records - Friday nights at mine usually consist of having a mix with my housemates Chris and Joe - we have hundreds of records between us, it's a bit of an addiction.</li>

            <li>Playing video games - anxiously awaiting the release of the new Zelda Breath of the Wild game...</li>
            <li>Watching anime - all time favourite is Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, Hunter X Hunter is a close second, a new favourite is Jujutsu Kaisen.</li>
